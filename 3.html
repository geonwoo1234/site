hello<br><strong>hello</strong><br><u>hello</u>
<p>Dominic, who has been on her honeymoon in Cuba with Letty since the last episode. I see my cousin being seized by default and participating in racing to help my cousin. The old car is on fire, and the movie begins with a scene of a wit driving backward and winning. Hobbes is going to his daughter's soccer match. Mr. Nobadi shows up and tells Hobbes to find the missing EMP bullet in the Middle East. Hobbes contacts Dom because it is a dangerous and overcrowded mission alone. So the party completes its mission in Berlin, but KSK starts chasing them.</p>
<p>In front of the arrested Hobbes, Novadi and his secretary promise to work with Natasha and promise release, but they coolly refuse. Hobbes meets Shaw inside the prison, and with Shaw, Hobbs tries to escape from the prison, but Novadi, who accompanied KSK, is waiting in front of the prison. Introduce the Cypher behind this. Dom gets a new mission to find out what the Cypher group is trying to do and stop him. And join the team in the show.</p>
<p>a summary...</p>
<p>There are two men suddenly wearing jet suits on Cypher's plane, and they are the Dekag Show and Owen Shaw brothers. Decard and Owen put together all of Cypher's men. The mission is completed cleanly and the dome family is gathered in New York. Nobadi comes and encourages him to return, but Hobbs says he wants to rest for his daughter. Dominic names his child Brian in front of his colleagues. After that, everyone prays before the meal and the movie ends. I really miss Paul Walker.
